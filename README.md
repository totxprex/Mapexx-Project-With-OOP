# Mapexx-Project-With-OOP

The Mapexx app allows you to log in your workout details by location, then saves these details for future reference to create accountabilty for your workout routines.
It even supports markups on a Live Map.

Fully programmed with the OOP paradigm. Code yet to be re-factored. I'll get to that :)
